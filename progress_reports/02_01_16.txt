Team X-RayFirst Progress Report

We've yet to begin any implementations. We downloaded the data set off kaggle
(It's massive!!!) and began looking into some methods of approaching this 
problem. On the open kaggle competition, many of the top results utilized 
convolutional neural nets to accurately classify the pictures, with the top 
entries scoring lower error percentages than humans. The links for the 
reading we've done so far are given below. On fastML, there's an article on 
doing object recognition with Alex Krizhevsky's cuda-convnet,
(http://fastml.com/object-recognition-in-images-with-cuda-convnet/) which we 
could possible end up using for our project once we gain some more intutions
about how CNNs work and how we can implement and improve on their initial
implementation.
